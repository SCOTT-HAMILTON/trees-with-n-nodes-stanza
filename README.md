<h1 align="center">trees-with-n-nodes-stanza - Stanza's implementation of the trees with n nodes problem</h1>

## Building
This project is configured with stanza's build system
```shell_session
$ stanza build
```

## Usage
My stanza version doesn't yet have the arg-parsing package.
So in the mean time, modify the src/main.stanza file to your needs and recompile.
You can, change the number of nodes per tree and print the tests, or anything else.

### Help
This is just a little project, but feel free to fork, change, extend or correct the code.
